# Loan Repayment in Banking - Machine Learning (classification)

##  Overview

This project revolves around developing and refining a predictive model tailored for the banking sector. Specifically, the objective is to construct a robust algorithm capable of determining the likelihood of loan repayment or default by customers. The foundation of this endeavor rests on a dataset designated for a hackathon, serving as the raw material for training and fine-tuning the model. Through meticulous data analysis and algorithmic training, the aim is to create a tool that can effectively assess the risk associated with extending loans to individual customers. Ultimately, the success of this project hinges on the accuracy and reliability of the predictive model, which holds the potential to enhance decision-making processes within the banking domain.


### Tools and Technologies
